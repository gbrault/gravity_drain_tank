short_description: 'Experimenting, Solving and simulating the Gravity Drain tank problem'
long_description: |
    The first step is to model the Gravity drain tank:
      - making a sketch
      - interacting with the sketch
      - the sketch is at the core of the digital mockup
    The second step is a reminder about the physics:
      - Torriceli's law, stating the speed of a water jet exiting the tank
      - Equation solving: how to solve the problem given all the variables from the sketch
    When all those step are covered, the simulation button on the bottom of the sketch is active
      - pushing the button animates the mockup according to the solved equations
      - the speed is x10 compared to actual speed
