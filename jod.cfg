name: 'Gravity Drain Tank'
short_description: 'Experimenting, Solving and simulating the Gravity Drain tank problem'
long_description: |
    1- Model the Gravity Drain Tank:
    
      * ploting the sketch (coming from a yaml definition file)
      * interacting with the sketch
      * the sketch is the core of the digital mockup
      
    2- Review the physics backgroud and Solve the Math:
    
      * Torriceli's law, stating the speed of a water jet exiting the tank
      * Equation solving: math solving the problem given all the variables from the sketch
      
    3- Simulate the physics
    
      * pushing the simulate button animates the mockup
      * the speed is x10 compared to actual speed
      * the solved equations dictate the behaviour
